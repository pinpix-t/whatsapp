Uploading from Phone:

- WhatsApp can compress photos - send as "Document" not "Photo"

Photo Storage Recommendations:

COLOR ACCURACY

Understanding Color Differences:
- Screens emit light (RGB color)
- Prints reflect light (CMYK color)
- Screens appear brighter than prints (normal)
- Different screens show different colors

Our Color Process:
- Industry-standard color profiles
- Calibrated printers
- Consistent color across products
- Professional color matching

If Colors Are Very Different:
- Check your screen brightness (should be ~50%)
- View print in natural daylight (not fluorescent light)
- If still significantly off, contact us for reprint

Color Management Tips:
- Don't over-edit on phone (often makes it worse)
- Avoid filters that dramatically change colors
- Natural photos usually print best
- Bright screens = prints may seem darker than expected

PRINT FINISHING OPTIONS

Glossy vs Matte:

Glossy:
- Shiny finish
- Vibrant colors
- Shows fingerprints easily
- Best for photos with bright colors

Matte:
- No glare
- Subtle, professional look
- Doesn't show fingerprints
- Best for framing behind glass

Border Options:
- Borderless: Photo extends to edge
- White border: Classic photo look
- Custom border: Available on some products
